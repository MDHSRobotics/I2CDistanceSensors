# I2CDistanceSensors

I2CDistanceSensors is an Arduino project that supports I2C communication with RoboRio and can support 2 distance sensors.

Sketch uses 5,360 bytes (16%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32,256 bytes.
Global variables use 616 bytes (30%) of dynamic memory, leaving 1,432 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2,048 bytes.



###Description

I2CDistanceSensors is a fork of [I2CArduino](https://github.com/MDHSRobotics/I2CArduino).  The HC-SR04 is a great low cost distance sensor, however, the RoboRio is unable to connect to it directly.  This project allows us to use an Arduino to interface HC-SR04 sensors to the RoboRio via the I2C interface.  

###Typical Use
